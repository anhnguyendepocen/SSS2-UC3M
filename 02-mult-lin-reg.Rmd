# Multiple linear regression {#mult}

The multiple linear regression is an *extension* of the simple linear regression. If the simple linear regression employed a *single* predictor $X$ to explain the response $Y$, the multiple linear regression employs *multiple* predictors $X_1,\ldots,X_p$ for explaining a single response $Y$. To convince you why is useful, let's see what it can do in real-case scenarios!
