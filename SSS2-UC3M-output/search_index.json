These notes are neither an exhaustive, rigorous nor comprehensive treatment of the broad statiscal branch know as Multivariate Analysis. Instead, they are a compact description of the key points and insights of the theory throught the help of computer, providing t the same time an effective way of delivering Software required R, a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. Deducer, a free easy to use alternative to proprietary data analysis software that provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for R, encouraging non-technical users to learn and perform analyses without programming getting in their way.

You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter ??. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter ??. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 1.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 1.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 1.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 1.1: Here is a nice table!

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2016) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015). This is a sample book written in Markdown. You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). For now, you have to install the development versions of bookdown from Github: devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. To compile this example to PDF, you need to install XeLaTeX. References "],
