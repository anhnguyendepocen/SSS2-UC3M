# Preface {-}

## What are these notes for? {-}

These notes are a compact description of the key points and insights of the methods presented in the lessons throught the help of computer, providing at the same time an effective way of delivering statistical analysis.

These notes **are neither an exhaustive, rigorous nor comprehensive treatment** of the broad statiscal branch know as Multivariate Analysis.

## Software required {-}

- [`R`](https://cran.r-project.org/), *a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics*.

- [`Deducer`](http://www.deducer.org/), a *free easy to use alternative to proprietary data analysis software* that *provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for `R`, encouraging non-technical users to learn and perform analyses without programming getting in their way*. 

## Logistics {-}

- Lessons in Computer Lab
- Doubts regarding theory -> Jose
- Doubts regarding implementation -> Eduardo
