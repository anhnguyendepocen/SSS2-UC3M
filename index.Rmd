# Some useful information {-}

We will cover 

## Software required {-}

- [`R`](https://cran.r-project.org/), *a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics*.

- [`Deducer`](http://www.deducer.org/), a *free easy to use alternative to proprietary data analysis software* that *provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for `R`, encouraging non-technical users to learn and perform analyses without programming getting in their way*. 


## Logistics {-}

- Lessons in Computer Lab
- Doubts regarding theory -> Jose
- Doubts regarding implementation -> Eduardo
